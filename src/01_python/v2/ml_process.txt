Machine Learning Process

    Data Pre-Processing
        - Import the data
        - Clean the data
        - Split into training % test sets

    Modelling
        - Build the model
        - Train the model
        - Make predictions

    Evaluation
        - Calculate performance metrics
        - Make a veredict


Train/Test sets (eg. 100 records)

    Train 80% -> 80 records to build the model
    
    Test 20%  -> 20 records to apply to the model and predict
                 based on the target values (these records are
                 not included in the training)

Feature Scaling

    Normalization: [0;1] based on min-max values. When a bounded range is needed
    
    Standardization: [-3;+3] based on avg & std dev. For data normally distributed





E.g. Normalization:

            Salary      Age
person 1    $70,000     45
person 2    $60,000     44
person 3    $52,000     40

Normalization = (X - Xmin) / (Xmax - Xmin)
Normalization person 2 = 60000 - 52000 / 70000 - 52000 = 8000 / 18000 = 0.44

Standardisation = (X - mean(X)) / std.dev(X)
std.dev = squared root of the deviation
